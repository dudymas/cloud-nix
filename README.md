# Wat

Nix-ified forms of tools I use regularly.

# Why

While I enjoy docker shells and virtual envs, they frequently don't perform
as fast or as cleanly as I'd like.

TODO:
- discuss docker vs nix
- discuss virtual envs vs nix
- why content addressable builds are important
- compare with [warpforge](https://warpforge.io/)
